# Incomplete Open Cubes

This was inspired by this 3Blue1Brown video.

Admittedly, I did not watch the whole video but just seeing the problem setup inspired me to pursue this. 

The problem setup is as follows:


In 1974, Sol LeWitt created an art piece representing all of the open cubes -- "variations of incomplete open cubes"

In the video it's mentioned that he manually had to draw out all 122 of the incomplete cubes. That's a lot of work!
Being the lazy bugger that I am, I immediately thought it'd be neat to programatically generate these open cubes.
Surely it's possible, but how would it even be done?
